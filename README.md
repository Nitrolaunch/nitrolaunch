Nitrolaunch is a Minecraft launcher and ecosystem meant to reinvent the launcher as you know it, providing a plugin system and a better interface with custom content such as mods and datapacks.

In the official launcher and many alternative ones, you have to waste time moving files in and out of folders, downloading mods from sketchy websites, setting up servers, and sharing your config to play with friends. Nitrolaunch hopes to alleviate some of these pains with its smart systems for configuration sharing and package management.

In addition, Nitrolaunch is extremely modular, allowing you to build your perfect launcher by hand, or just use the amazing tools already built by the community.
