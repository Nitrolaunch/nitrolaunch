# auto-mcs
ID: `auto_mcs`

The auto-mcs plugin provides integration with the auto-mcs server launcher, with features like instance import and export.

## Usage

### Import Instances
Create an auto-mcs backup of your server, or select all the files in your auto-mcs server (not the folder containing them) and compress them to a `.zip` file. Use the `nitro instance import` command along with the `auto_mcs` format to import the instance into Nitrolaunch.
