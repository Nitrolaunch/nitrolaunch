# Config Split
ID: `config_split`

The Config Split plugin allows you to have some parts of your configuration in separate files.

## Usage
Run a command such as `instance list` to generate the directories. To add new instances and templates to your config, create files called `<instance>.json` or `<template>.json` in your config directory, under the `instances` and `templates` directories. Then, put the JSON configuration for it inside that new file.
