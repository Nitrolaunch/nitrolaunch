# Smithed
ID: `smithed`

The Smithed plugin will add the `smithed` package repository, allowing you to install Smithed packs as packages on your instances and profiles.

## Usage
Browse packages under the Smithed repository or add them manually in your config by putting `smithed:` before the package ID.

This plugin will also provide the profile `smithed-base`, which sets up Weld and a global datapacks mod to make playing Smithed packs easy.
