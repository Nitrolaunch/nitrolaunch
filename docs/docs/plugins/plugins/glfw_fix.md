# GLFW Fix
ID: `glfw_fix`

The GLFW Fix plugin fixes memory errors and crashes when starting the game with mods. It does this by downloading a newer version of GLFW and applying it to the instance.

## Usage
To enable the fix on an instance or profile, set `"fix_glfw"` to true on that instance or profile in your config.
