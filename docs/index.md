# Nitrolaunch Documentation

This is the user and developer documentation for Nitrolaunch.

To get started with the launcher, check out the [user guide](guide/index.md).

Documentation for the CLI can be found by running `nitro help`. Examples for the library can be found in the code for the CLI, as it is a simple implementation of all the functionality. All library crates should have code documentation hosted on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs).
